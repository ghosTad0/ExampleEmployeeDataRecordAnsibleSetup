I have 3 main things to do, to get this done.

- setting up mysql
- setting up mginx
- setting up the real application


Setting up mysql
    - setting up mysql binary, dnf install is hard and spoils the system with a lot of garbage
    - used docker to up a mysql container and its pretty ez. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/). Also for installing docker
      we can ezly write an ansible playbook and can trigger it when we want. (for example before turning mysql container up, or create 
      create from the beginning, i can check the server's status of docker installation, if docker was not found, heck run installation playbook)
