How to create ansible roles
```````````````````````````
    ansible-galaxy init /path/to/create/roles --offline
    
    - now dir will be created
    - each subdir should have main.yml file
        - defaults/, vars/
            both dirs are used to define ansible variables. But var has the priority. Means variables in defaults will be
            overriden in variables defined in vars
        - files/
            files which gonna be transfered to remote
        - meta/
            supported platforms, version differences etc (additional data about role)
        - tasks/
            all tasks of the role


Converting an existing playbook to a role
``````````````````````````````````````````

/role1/tasks/
    main.yml
        import_tasks: tasks1.yml
        import_tasks: tasks2.yml
        import_tasks: tasks3.yml  #these include different tasks that can be grouped together
    
    tasks1.yml
        - name: Install httpd
          yum:
            name:
                - httpd
            state: latest
