ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key

The error appears to be in '/home/tuan/MyDir/office_work/AAP/__sampleApps/__ansible_deployments_for_apps/employee_recorder_ansible_deployment/playbooks/sample_app_deploy_appservers.yml': line 60, column 27, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

          # when: "'mysql_docker' not in mysql_docker_installation_details.stdout"
          when: 'CREATE,' not in previlege_details.stdout | default(True)
                          ^ here
This one looks easy to fix. It seems that there is a value started
with a quote, and the YAML parser is expecting to see the line ended
with the same kind of quote. For instance:

    when: "ok" in result.stdout

Could be written as:

   when: '"ok" in result.stdout'

Or equivalently:

   when: "'ok' in result.stdout"
