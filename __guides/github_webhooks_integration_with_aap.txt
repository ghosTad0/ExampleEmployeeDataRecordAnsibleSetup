I have a doubt regarding ansible automation platform. Is there anyway to accept notification from github 
(let's say a change in branch) and run some workflow once the notification is taken?



ChatGPT

Yes, you can integrate GitHub with Ansible Automation Platform to trigger workflows based on GitHub events, such as branch changes or pull requests. To achieve this, you can use GitHub Webhooks to notify a service that will then trigger an Ansible workflow. Here’s a general approach on how to set this up:
Overview of Steps

    Configure a Webhook in GitHub:
        GitHub will send notifications to a specific URL when certain events occur (e.g., branch changes).

    Set Up a Receiver for GitHub Webhooks:
        You need a service or endpoint to receive and process the webhook payload from GitHub.

    Trigger Ansible Automation Platform Workflow:
        Once the webhook is received, it can trigger an Ansible workflow or job.

Detailed Steps
1. Configure a Webhook in GitHub

    Go to your GitHub repository.
    Navigate to Settings > Webhooks.
    Click Add webhook.
    In the "Payload URL" field, enter the URL of the service that will receive the webhook.
    Select application/json as the content type.
    Choose the events you want to listen for, such as Push events.
    Click Add webhook to save.

2. Set Up a Receiver for GitHub Webhooks

You need a server or service to receive the webhook payload from GitHub. This can be a custom application or a serverless function that you configure. For simplicity, let's consider using a simple script on a server:

    Example Python Script Using Flask:

    python

    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    import requests

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
    def webhook():
        data = request.json
        # Process the webhook data here
        print(data)
        
        # Trigger Ansible Automation Platform job
        response = requests.post(
            'https://ansible.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/<JOB_TEMPLATE_ID>/launch/',
            headers={
                'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ANSIBLE_API_TOKEN',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            json={}
        )
        
        return jsonify({'status': 'received'}), 200

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)


        Replace https://ansible.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/<JOB_TEMPLATE_ID>/launch/ with the URL for launching an Ansible job, and YOUR_ANSIBLE_API_TOKEN with a valid API token.

    Deploy this script on a server or use a cloud function/service to expose an endpoint.

3. Trigger Ansible Automation Platform Workflow

To trigger a workflow in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) from the webhook, you use the Ansible Tower API. Ensure you have:

    Ansible API Token:
        You’ll need an API token to authenticate requests to the Ansible Automation Platform.

    Job Template ID:
        Identify the job template you want to launch. You can find this in the AAP interface.

    Example API Request to Trigger a Job Template:

    bash

    curl -X POST https://ansible.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/<JOB_TEMPLATE_ID>/launch/ \
         -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANSIBLE_API_TOKEN' \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -d '{}'

Summary

    Set up a GitHub webhook to send notifications to your server when a relevant event occurs.
    Create a service that receives the webhook payload and processes it.
    Trigger an Ansible Automation Platform job by making an API request from your service when the webhook is received.

This setup allows you to automate your workflows and respond to changes in your GitHub repository in real-time.
